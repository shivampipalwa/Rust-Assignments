/*
  Problem 50: Byte Manipulation — Pack Two u16 into u32

  Write a function pack_u16(high, low) that packs two u16 values into a single u32
  (high in upper 16 bits, low in lower 16 bits). Write a companion unpack_u32(packed)
  that reverses the operation.

  Run the tests for this problem with:
    cargo test --test pack_u16_test
*/

pub fn pack_u16(high: u16, low: u16) -> u32 {
    ((high as u32) << 16) | low as u32
}

pub fn unpack_u32(packed: u32) -> (u16, u16) {
    ((packed >> 16) as u16, (packed & 0xFFFF) as u16)
}
