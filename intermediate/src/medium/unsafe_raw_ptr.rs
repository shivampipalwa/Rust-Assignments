/*
  Problem 44: Unsafe — Raw Pointer Dereference

  Write a function that takes a reference to an i32, converts it to a raw pointer,
  and reads the value through an unsafe dereference. Return the dereferenced value.
  This is a minimal demonstration of raw pointers in unsafe Rust.

  Run the tests for this problem with:
    cargo test --test unsafe_raw_ptr_test
*/

pub fn read_via_raw_pointer(value: &i32) -> i32 {
    let r = &raw const *value;
    unsafe { return *r }
}
